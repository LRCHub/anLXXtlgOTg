[00:57.28] The way she came into the place I knew right then and there
[01:01.66] There was something different about this girl
[01:05.82] The way she moved
[01:07.57] Her hair, her face, her lines
[01:11.03] Divinity in motion
[01:14.06] As she stalked the room
[01:16.10] I could feel the aura of her presence
[01:18.77] Every head turned feeling passion and lust
[01:22.03] The girl was persuasive
[01:23.96] The girl I could not trust
[01:26.36] The girl was bad
[01:28.41] The girl was dangerous
[01:39.41] 
[01:30.29] I never knew
[01:31.53] But I was walking the line
[01:34.42] Come go with me
[01:35.67] I said "I have no time"
[01:38.52] And don't you pretend
[01:39.73] We didn't talk on the phone
[01:42.84] My baby cried
[01:44.13] She left me standing alone
[01:57.13] 
[01:46.39] She's so dangerous
[01:50.19] The girl is so dangerous
[01:55.39] Take away my money
[01:57.36] Throw away my time
[01:59.56] You can call me honey
[02:01.53] But you're no damn good for me
[02:16.53] 
[02:13.95] She came at me in sections
[02:16.04] With the eyes of desire
[02:18.22] I felt trapped into her web of sin
[02:22.67] A touch, a kiss
[02:25.48] A whisper of love
[02:27.31] I was at the point of no return
[02:30.34] Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
[02:34.10] I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
[02:38.57] This girl was persuasive
[02:40.56] This girl I could not trust
[02:42.87] The girl was bad
[02:44.97] The girl was dangerous
[02:55.97] 
[02:46.63] I never knew
[02:48.00] But I was living in vain
[02:50.93] She called my house
[02:52.10] She said "you know my name"
[02:54.92] And don't you pretend
[02:56.33] You never did me before
[02:59.14] With tears in her eyes
[03:00.84] My baby walked out the door
[03:14.34] 
[03:02.81] She's so dangerous
[03:06.66] The girl is so dangerous
[03:11.78] Take away my money
[03:13.86] Throw away my time
[03:16.19] You can call me honey
[03:18.07] But you're no damn good for me
[03:33.07] 
[03:20.65] Dangerous
[03:23.68] The girl is so dangerous
[03:28.84] I have to pray to God
[03:30.52] 'Cause I know how lust can blind
[03:33.12] It's a passion in my soul
[03:35.08] But you're no damn lover friend of mine
[03:54.58] 
[03:55.67] I cannot sleep alone at night
[03:59.94] My baby left me here tonight
[04:04.16] I cannot cope till it's all right
[04:07.75] You and your manipulation
[04:09.64] You hurt my baby
[04:17.64] 
[04:12.80] And then it happened
[04:14.16] She touched me
[04:16.31] For the lips of a strange woman
[04:18.77] Drop as a honeycomb
[04:21.13] And her mouth was smoother than oil
[04:23.18] But her inner spirit as sharp as a two-edged sword
[04:26.11] But I loved it
[04:27.35] 'Cause it's dangerous
[04:37.85] 
[04:28.72] Dangerous
[04:31.51] The girl is so dangerous
[04:36.97] Take away my money
[04:39.07] Throw away my time
[04:41.15] You can call me honey
[04:43.01] But you're no damn good for me
[04:58.01] 
[04:45.67] Dangerous
[04:48.62] The girl is so dangerous
[04:53.90] Take away my money
[04:55.93] Throw away my time
[04:58.12] You can call me honey
[05:00.08] But you're no damn good for me
[05:15.08] 
[05:02.80] Dangerous
[05:05.61] The girl is so dangerous
[05:10.91] Take away my money
[05:13.02] Throw away my time
[05:15.22] You can call me honey
[05:17.00] But you're no damn good for me
[05:32.00] 
[05:19.80] Dangerous
[05:22.66] The girl is so dangerous
[05:27.86] I have to pray to God
[05:29.74] 'Cause I know how lust can blind
[05:32.11] It's a passion in my soul
[05:33.97] But you're no damn lover friend of mine
[05:53.47] 
[05:44.01] My baby
[05:47.52] You bet, you uh, you don't, you don't, don't
[05:52.44] My baby
